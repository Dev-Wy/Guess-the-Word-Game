## Overview
- Players guess the word by entering one letter at a time. If the player guesses all the letters correctly before they use up their allotted guesses, they win!

## My Process
### Built with
- JavaScript
- Manipulate the DOM

### What I learned
- I learned how to manipulate the DOM and enhance my Vanilla JavaScript skills. I also became familiar randomizing within JS functions.

### Continued development
- I would like to add hitting the "Enter" or "Return" key as a way to contribute an answer. 

### Useful Resources:
